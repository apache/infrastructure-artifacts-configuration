This repository contains the configuration directives and KEYS files for ASF projects

Each project has its own directory, each containing a `KEYS` file (for release signing keys) and a `settings.yaml` file for distribution policy settings.
These settings can be updated by projects through the artifacts.apache.org web interface, or manually by the Infrastructure team through this repository.

Changes are automatically synced to/from this repository.
